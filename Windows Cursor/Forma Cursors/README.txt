HOW TO USE FORMA CURSORS:

A PC with the latest version of Windows is recommended with a 1080p Full HD monitor.
This version of Forma Cursors does not natively support 4K displays.
Upon extracting the zip file of Forma Cursors.zip, you should receive two folders named "Standard" and "Inverted", and two .txt files "LICENSE" and "README" (you are currently reading the README).

In order to install and start using Forma Cursors, simply navigate into either the Shadowed or Shadowless variants of Standard or Inverted, and right click and install "INSTALL.inf". After a brief period, Forma Cursors should install to your "C:\Windows\Cursors" directory (providing you haven't changed your system's root directory).
You can then activate and use Forma Cursors by clicking on the Windows taskbar icon, typing in "pointer" and clicking "Change the mouse pointer display or speed".
A classic theme window titled "Mouse Properties" should appear. Clicking on the "Pointers" tab immediately to the right of "Buttons" should show a droplist below "Scheme" so you can select Forma Cursors. Finally, click "Apply" in the lower right and "OK" to close the window.

In both standard and inverted folders are subfolders that provide the cursors with and without built-in shadows. You can use the shadowless variants with the built-in hardware rendered shadows via "Enable pointer shadow" in "Mouse Properties".
